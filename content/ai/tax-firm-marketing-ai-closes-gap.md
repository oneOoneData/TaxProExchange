Tax professionals are usually comfortable with complexity. We translate laws into regulatory requirements, we account for discrepancies, we understand K-1's, and we complete forms as if they were puzzles.

However, when you ask a group of small tax practitioners how confident they are in their marketing strategy, the tone changes.

Most will admit (quietly) they have no idea if their website is helping them, hurting them, or simply sitting there gathering digital dust.

There are many small firms, mine included when I was first starting, which struggle structurally with their marketing efforts.

You can be incredibly skilled at doing tax work and be completely invisible online.

And the effects of being invisible may show up months after the fact when new client volume drops off and/or the only leads you receive are from low-quality shoppers.

To open a tax firm online is equivalent to opening a store in the middle of a cornfield.

No one is going to see you.

When I began my practice in Encinitas, I had all the elements recommended by every guide for a website:

- a website
- a Google Business Profile
- a plan to post articles to help people

And still, nothing changed.

Not because I didn't produce high quality work.

Not because clients weren't available.

Because digital visibility does not respond to effort; it responds to signals of authority, consistency and the right signals.

I ultimately realized that what most small tax firms learn:

- Good content is not enough
- A good website is not enough
- Having a Google listing is not enough
- Writing articles nobody reads accomplishes nothing

Marketing a tax firm is not a one time setup.

It is a continuous process - and most small firms lack the bandwidth to operate the loop effectively.

## The common and predictable errors

My experience is similar to many others:

- Set up an SEO agency - Pay a lot → Get very little → Realize it was not designed for tax professionals.
- Create blog articles - Helpful and accurate… but rarely read.
- Test different website builders - WIX auto-blog, WordPress templates, custom websites built in Cursor. Beneficial, but none transformative.
- Experiment with AI writing tools - They generate content but lack strategy, cadence, and differentiation. They often make you sound like everyone else.

Eventually, you come to the realization:

Marketing a tax practice is not about performing one task.

It is an ecosystem of:

- keyword research
- competitor research
- structured content strategy
- weekly publishing
- local SEO
- building backlinks
- social distribution

That is not one person's job - that is multiple jobs.

And most firms do not have one person dedicated to it.

Therefore, the question remains: Can AI finally fill this gap?

This is where the conversation changes.

I am not referring to the hype ("AI will do everything!").

I am referring to practical relief for a problem that has existed for years.

During the last year, I tested:

- WIX's automated blogging
- Blaze.ai for AI-assisted social content
- Custom site builds via Cursor
- Automated local SEO
- Auto-publishing scheduling applications

Helpful, yes. Comprehensive, no.

Most current AI tools support content creation, but they cannot address the strategic layer:

- What should your firm write about this week - and why?
- What local keywords matter?
- Why is a competitor ranking higher than you?
- What topics create "tax expertise" in Google's eyes?
- How should each article link to others?
- How often should new content be published?

These are the types of questions agencies charge thousands to answer.

Historically, they have been difficult to automate.

That is changing.

## What the next generation of AI tools is trying to resolve

Companies are beginning to explore more comprehensive solutions: systems that aim to unify audits, content planning, creation, and publishing within a single coordinated workflow.

This matters because marketing activities that previously required multiple specialists may soon be managed from a single interface - with human oversight rather than human labor.

## A Missing Piece: Social Media - And the Rise of Headless Social Channels

Another area where small tax firms often struggle is social media. Not because they don't understand its value, but because most believe they don't have the time to maintain it.

And to be fair - the old model of social media did require time: filming, editing, writing captions, posting consistently, monitoring engagement.

But the next wave of tools - including emerging tools now being developed - is changing that model entirely.

### Headless Social Media: What It Means

"Headless social media" is the idea that your firm can maintain an active, credible social presence without you manually creating or posting content.

Instead of logging into LinkedIn, Instagram, or Facebook to write posts, the system:

- pulls from your long-form content
- turns articles into short posts
- formats them for each platform
- auto-publishes on a schedule
- keeps your channels active even when you're deep in tax season

This means a firm owner who feels they "don't have time for social media" can still:

- maintain a presence
- build trust
- demonstrate consistency
- stay competitive

…all without touching the platforms directly.

These emerging tools are designed to support this kind of workflow - reducing the friction that keeps most small practices from ever posting.

## What does this change mean for smaller tax firms?

Large firms will adopt AI quickly - but they already have in-house marketing teams.

Smaller firms stand to benefit the most:

- No internal marketing team - AI can take over repetitive tasks.
- Little consistency in published content - AI can maintain predictable cadence.
- No time or money for SEO - AI can continuously monitor and adjust.
- Competition is hyper-local - small increases in visibility produce noticeable results.
- Clients search online first - visibility has become a requirement.

This is not about creating explosive, rapid growth.

It is about eliminating friction so you can show up online more often than not.

## Tax Accounting and AI - The future for small accounting firms

Small tax accounting firms are being transformed by AI in ways that seemed unattainable even one year ago. The changes are significant, not slight; they are fundamental. What was previously available only to larger firms (with their greater budgets) using large teams and an abundance of time - is now available to all firms, big or small, thanks to automation and integration.

Small firms, such as my firm, have access to the same type of marketing options that were previously unavailable to them - regular content publishing, strategic search engine optimization, social media presence, and operational cadence needed to build visibility over time.

It's not about taking short cuts - it's about leveraging technology. And leverage makes a difference.

AI has changed the cost structure, the amount of time required to accomplish tasks, and the ceiling of what is possible. Tasks that took hours to complete can be completed in minutes. Work flows that required numerous specialists are now being coordinated and performed within a single system, with human decision making added when appropriate.

I recently had the opportunity to speak with Mike de Ravel, CEO of MITCO Digital, regarding this transformation. MITCO Digital is developing tools designed to alleviate many of the problems associated with operating a small tax accounting firm, tools that will not only create content but also will provide the framework for the overall strategy behind that content.

<blockquote style="margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none; font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.75; color: #1f2937; font-style: italic;">

I speak with small firm owners every week, and the story is always the same - no budget for a full-time marketer, no time to create content, and no real know-how. And let's be honest, most tax professionals don't want to be doing their own marketing anyway.

The online space for tax firms is more competitive than ever. You can't depend on one channel anymore. You need a strong website, SEO, social posts, video, blogs, and - most importantly - a clear strategy that underpins it all.

That's exactly why we're launching our AI Marketing Assistant. It gives smaller firms a foot in the game. It will build their website, create expert blogs, social content, videos, and more as we continue rolling out upgrades. And unlike generic AI tools that just pump out content, ours is built on proven agency strategy, so every output actually drives results - not noise.

The firms that lean into this early will not just "keep up." They will outpace. They will outpublish. They will outrank. And they will appear everywhere clients are looking.

The firms that don't? They will still exist - but increasingly in that same digital cornfield I once found myself standing.
