    },

      question: 'How do you verify credentials?',
      answer: 'We manually check state CPA boards, IRS EA enrollment, and CTEC registration before profiles are visible.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is it free?',
      answer: 'Yes for individuals â€” forever. Tax professionals can join free, create profiles, and connect with others at no cost. Firms pay $10/month to access team workspace features and build their trusted bench.'
