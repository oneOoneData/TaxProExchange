# Cursor Task Notes

## 2025-10-17: Google reCAPTCHA v3 Integration

### Summary
Implemented Google reCAPTCHA v3 protection for public forms and enhanced footer trust badges to improve security and user trust.

### Changes Made
1. **Environment Configuration** (`env.example`)
   - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` 
   - Added `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`

2. **reCAPTCHA Script Integration** (`components/DomainAwareLayout.tsx`)
   - Added Next.js Script component for reCAPTCHA v3
   - Preconnect to Google domains for performance
   - Lazy load strategy to avoid blocking page load

3. **reCAPTCHA Utilities** (`lib/recaptcha.ts`) - NEW FILE
   - `verifyRecaptcha()` - Server-side token verification with configurable score threshold
   - `executeRecaptcha()` - Client-side token generation helper
   - TypeScript definitions for grecaptcha global

4. **Suggest Event Form Protection** (`app/suggest-event/page.tsx`)
   - Integrated reCAPTCHA execution before form submission
   - Passes token to API for verification
   - Graceful fallback if reCAPTCHA fails to load

5. **API Verification** (`app/api/events/suggest/route.ts`)
   - Verify reCAPTCHA token with 0.3 score threshold (public form)
   - Made authentication optional (was previously required)
   - Support both authenticated and anonymous submissions
   - Bot protection via reCAPTCHA instead of auth requirement

6. **Enhanced Footer Trust Badges** (`components/Footer.tsx`)
   - Replaced emoji icons with professional SVG lock/shield icons
   - Updated badges: SSL Secured, reCAPTCHA Protected, Secure Auth, RLS Security
   - Improved visual consistency and professionalism

### Security Implementation
- **Score Threshold**: 0.3 for public forms (balanced between security and UX)
- **Verification**: Server-side verification prevents client-side bypass
- **Graceful Degradation**: Forms work even if reCAPTCHA fails to load
- **Privacy**: reCAPTCHA v3 runs invisibly without user interaction

### Forms Protected
- ‚úÖ `/suggest-event` - Public event suggestion form (primary use case)
- Note: Other forms (feedback, jobs, applications) already protected by Clerk authentication

### Next Steps
1. Get reCAPTCHA v3 keys from Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console
2. Add keys to Vercel Environment Variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
   - `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`
3. Test form submission at `/suggest-event`
4. Monitor reCAPTCHA scores in Google Admin Console
5. Adjust score threshold if needed based on bot traffic

## Profile Update Bug Fix (2025-10-16) ‚úÖ

**Bug**: User Jeremy Wells (jeremy@steadfastbookkeeping.com) getting error "Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object" when completing profile.

**Root Cause**: 
- Profile lookup was finding the profile by email (returns profile ID)
- But the UPDATE query was using `.eq('clerk_id', clerk_id)` instead of `.eq('id', existingProfile.id)`
- If the profile had a different/null clerk_id, the UPDATE would affect 0 rows
- The `.single()` call expects exactly 1 row, causing PGRST116 error

**Fix Applied**:
1. Changed UPDATE query to use profile ID instead of clerk_id (line 455)
2. Added `clerk_id` to updateData to ensure it's synced when profile found by email (line 419)

### Files Changed

1. **`app/api/profile/route.ts`**
   - Line 455: Changed `.eq('clerk_id', clerk_id)` ‚Üí `.eq('id', existingProfile.id)`
   - Line 419: Added `clerk_id` to updateData to sync clerk_id when profile found by email

**Impact**: Users with profiles found by email (but with missing/different clerk_id) can now successfully complete their profiles.

**Root Cause Deep Dive**:
The `profiles` table has BOTH `clerk_id` and `clerk_user_id` columns from an incomplete migration. Different endpoints use different columns:
- Old: `app/api/firms/route.ts` and `app/api/profile/create/route.ts` use `clerk_user_id`
- New: `app/api/profile/route.ts` uses `clerk_id`
- Some code uses OR logic to check both (e.g., `lib/db/profile.ts`)

Jeremy's profile was likely created via the firms endpoint (which sets `clerk_user_id`) but his `clerk_id` was NULL/different, causing the UPDATE to match 0 rows.

**Recommended**: See `CLERK_ID_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` for full migration strategy to consolidate to a single column.

**Prevention (2025-10-16)**: Enhanced existing Clerk webhook to auto-sync clerk_id on user.created/user.updated events. This prevents future mismatches when users recreate accounts. See `app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`.

## Firm Admin Full Participation (2025-10-13) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Allow firm admins to fully participate in the platform without creating a separate tax pro profile.

**Problem**: 
Firm admins were created with `visibility_state: 'hidden'` and `is_listed: false`, which meant:
- Their profiles couldn't be viewed by anyone (404 errors)
- They couldn't receive connection requests
- They couldn't participate in networking, jobs, or mentorship
- **Result**: Firm admins were creating duplicate tax pro accounts just to participate

**Solution Applied**:
Changed firm admins from "hidden" to "verified but unlisted":
- ‚úÖ **Verified** visibility state (profiles are viewable)
- ‚úÖ **Not listed** by default (won't clutter search results)
- ‚úÖ **Premium badge** shows "üè¢ Firm Member" on profile
- ‚úÖ **Linked firm** displays on their profile page
- ‚úÖ **Can toggle listing** (future: allow them to opt into search)

### Files Changed

1. **`database/2025-10-13_upgrade_firm_admins.sql`** (NEW)
   - Migration to upgrade existing firm_admin profiles from `hidden` to `verified`
   - Preserves `is_listed: false` (they stay out of search)
   - Updates comment documentation

2. **`app/api/firms/route.ts`**
   - Changed new firm_admin creation: `visibility_state: 'verified'` (was `'hidden'`)
   - Updated comment: "Not listed in search by default (but can toggle on)"
   - Firm admins can now be viewed and participate fully

3. **`lib/db/profile.ts`**
   - Added `profile_type` field to `Profile` interface
   - Added `isFirmMember()` helper function
   - Added `getFirmMemberBadgeColor()` for premium gold/amber badge styling

4. **`app/api/profile-firm/route.ts`** (NEW)
   - Public endpoint to fetch firm info for a profile
   - Used to show linked firm on profile pages
   - Returns firm name, slug, website, verified status

5. **`app/api/profile/[slug]/route.ts`**
   - Added `profile_type` to SELECT query
   - Now includes profile type in API response

6. **`app/p/[slug]/ProfilePageClient.tsx`**
   - Added `profile_type` to Profile interface
   - Added `userFirm` state to store linked firm
   - Added useEffect to fetch firm info for firm_admin profiles
   - Added "üè¢ Firm Member" premium badge next to verified badge
   - Added clickable firm link (with icon) that navigates to `/f/{slug}`

7. **`components/dashboard/ProfileStatusCard.tsx`**
   - Imported `isFirmMember` and `getFirmMemberBadgeColor` helpers
   - Added "üè¢ Firm Member" badge display for firm admins
   - Badge appears on dashboard profile status card

### Behavior Changes

**Before**:
- Firm admin creates firm ‚Üí gets hidden profile ‚Üí can't participate ‚Üí creates 2nd tax pro profile üòû

**After**:
- Firm admin creates firm ‚Üí gets verified profile ‚Üí can participate fully ‚Üí one account does everything üéâ

**Visibility**:
- **Search**: Firm admins CAN appear in search if they set `is_listed: true`
- **Direct profile view**: Works! Anyone can view `/p/{firm-admin-slug}`
- **Badge**: Premium "üè¢ Firm Member" badge distinguishes them
- **Firm link**: Their profile shows clickable link to their firm page

### Update (2025-10-13 Part 2): Search Toggle Implemented ‚úÖ

**Additional Changes**:

8. **`app/api/search/route.ts`**
   - Removed hardcoded `profile_type != 'firm_admin'` filter
   - Now relies solely on `is_listed` field for search visibility
   - Both tax_professional AND firm_admin can be searchable if they choose

9. **`app/profile/edit/page.tsx`**
   - Added `is_listed` to ProfileForm interface
   - Added "Include my profile in the searchable directory" checkbox
   - Located in Visibility & Availability section (after public_contact)
   - Includes helpful explanation text
   - Saves to database on profile update

10. **`database/2025-10-13_enable_firm_admin_search_toggle.sql`** (NEW)
    - Migration to enable search for specific firm admins
    - Example: Kellan Johnson (recruiter who wants to be discoverable)

**New Default Behavior**:
- **tax_professional**: `is_listed: true` by default (searchable)
- **firm_admin**: `is_listed: false` by default (private, can opt-in)
- **User control**: Anyone can toggle their search visibility in profile settings

## Admin Firm Workspace Management & Deletion (2025-10-12) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Allow TPE admins to view and delete actual firm workspace accounts (separate from profile enrichment data).

**Problem**: 
Initial implementation confused two different concepts:
- **`/admin/firms`** - Shows individual tax pro profiles with firm information (for enrichment/analytics)
- **What was needed** - A view of actual firm workspace accounts from the `firms` table (real signups with teams)

**Solution Applied**:
Created a separate admin interface for managing actual firm workspaces at `/admin/firm-workspaces`.

### Files Created

1. **`app/api/admin/firm-workspaces/route.ts`** (NEW)
   - GET endpoint to list firms from `firms` table (not `profiles`)
   - Includes member counts via join with `firm_members`
   - Supports search, sort, and pagination
   - Shows subscription status, size band, returns band

2. **`app/api/admin/firm-workspaces/[id]/route.ts`** (NEW)
   - DELETE endpoint to remove a firm workspace by ID
   - Checks admin authorization via Clerk
   - Deletes firm record (cascades to related tables via foreign keys)

3. **`components/admin/FirmWorkspacesGrid.tsx`** (NEW)
   - Table view of actual firm workspace accounts
   - Shows: name, website, member count, size, returns, subscription status, verified status
   - Delete button with confirmation dialog
   - Search and pagination

4. **`app/admin/firm-workspaces/page.tsx`** (NEW)
   - Admin page for managing firm workspaces
   - Clear description: "actual firm workspace accounts that have signed up"

### Files Modified

1. **`app/admin/page.tsx`**
   - Renamed "Manage Firms" ‚Üí "Firm Enrichment" (clarified it's for profile data)
   - Added new "Firm Workspaces" card
   - Updated navigation to include both links: "Enrichment" and "Workspaces"

2. **`app/api/admin/firms/[id]/route.ts`** (from previous commit)
   - Fixed Next.js 15 async params compatibility

### User Flow

**For Profile Enrichment** (`/admin/firms`):
1. Admin ‚Üí "Firm Enrichment"
2. Views profiles with firm information
3. Can enrich with live website data
4. Used for analytics and data quality

**For Firm Workspaces** (`/admin/firm-workspaces`):
1. Admin ‚Üí "Firm Workspaces"
2. Views actual firm accounts that signed up
3. Can see member counts and subscription status
4. Can delete firm workspaces
5. Deletes cascade to all related data

### Related Database Tables

- `firms` - Main firm workspace records
- `firm_members` - Team members (cascades on firm deletion)
- `firm_trusted_bench` - Firm's trusted contacts (cascades on firm deletion)
- `firm_subscription_events` - Subscription history (cascades on firm deletion)

## Firm Admin Profile Type (2025-10-11) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Allow firm creation without requiring tax professional credentials.

**Problem**: 
Firm admins (office managers, non-practicing owners, operations staff) couldn't create firm workspaces because they were required to complete tax professional onboarding first.

**Solution Applied**:
Added `profile_type` field to distinguish between `tax_professional` and `firm_admin` users. Firm admins are auto-created when someone creates a firm without an existing profile, and they're excluded from the searchable directory.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Database Migration
- **File**: `database/2025-10-11_profile_type.sql`
- Added `profile_type` column to profiles table
- Values: `'tax_professional'` (default) | `'firm_admin'`
- Backfilled existing profiles as `'tax_professional'`
- Added constraint and index for filtering

#### 2. Auto-Create Firm Admin Profiles
- **File**: `app/api/firms/route.ts` (POST endpoint)
- When user creates firm without existing profile:
  - Fetches user info from Clerk (name, email)
  - Auto-creates minimal `firm_admin` profile
  - Sets `profile_type: 'firm_admin'`
  - Sets `is_listed: false` and `visibility_state: 'unlisted'`
  - Marks `onboarding_complete: true` (skip credential requirements)
- Profile is linked to firm as admin member

#### 3. Exclude Firm Admins from Search
- **File**: `app/api/search/route.ts`
- Added filter: `.neq('profile_type', 'firm_admin')`
- Firm admins never appear in directory/search results
- Only tax professionals with credentials are searchable

### User Flow

**For Tax Professionals** (existing flow):
1. Sign up ‚Üí Complete tax pro onboarding ‚Üí Create firm (optional)

**For Firm Admins** (new flow):
1. Sign up ‚Üí Go to `/firm` ‚Üí Create firm workspace
2. System auto-creates `firm_admin` profile behind the scenes
3. Can immediately manage firm team roster
4. Won't appear in public directory

### Files Changed
1. `database/2025-10-11_profile_type.sql` - New migration
2. `app/api/firms/route.ts` - Auto-create firm_admin profiles
3. `app/api/search/route.ts` - Exclude firm_admin from search
4. `app/(onboarding)/firm/page.tsx` - Already works (no profile check needed)

### Notes
- Firm admins capture: name, email, Clerk ID
- No credential requirements for firm_admin type
- Can still convert to tax_professional later if desired (future enhancement)
- Maintains referential integrity (all firm members must have profiles)

## Onboarding Flow Streamlining (2025-10-10) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Remove legal consent step from onboarding and fix credential issues.

**Problem**: 
1. Legal consent step added friction to onboarding
2. "Other Professional" credential type was showing license fields and causing validation errors
3. License numbers weren't being retained between onboarding credentials screen and profile edit screen

**Solution Applied**:
1. Removed legal consent as a separate onboarding step - now auto-accepted on profile creation
2. Fixed "Other" credential type to not require licenses (same as "Student")
3. Included `license_number` in GET endpoint for users viewing their own profile

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Removed Legal Consent Onboarding Step
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx`: Redirects new users directly to `/onboarding/credentials` (not `/onboarding/consent`)
- `app/onboarding/create-profile/page.tsx`: Updated messaging from "Legal Documents Accepted" to "Create Your Profile"
- `app/api/profile/route.ts`: Auto-accepts legal terms (TOS v1, Privacy v1) when creating new profiles
- Legal documents still accessible via footer links at `/legal/terms` and `/legal/privacy`

#### 2. Fixed "Other Professional" Credential Type
- `components/forms/CredentialSection.tsx`: 
  - Now treats "Other" same as "Student" - no license fields required
  - Added informative message: "Other professionals can join without credentials"
  - Updated all logic to check for both `credential_type === 'Student'` and `credential_type === 'Other'`
- `app/api/profile/route.ts`: 
  - Excludes "Other" from license saving (line 614)
  - Removes any existing licenses when switching to "Other" (line 657-664)

#### 3. License Number Retention
- `app/api/profile/route.ts` GET endpoint (line 156): 
  - Now includes `license_number` in query when user fetches their own profile
  - This allows license data to persist between onboarding credentials ‚Üí profile edit
  - Users can see and edit their own license numbers
  - Note: Public profile views (via `/p/[slug]`) still exclude `license_number` for privacy

#### 4. Updated Step Counter
- `app/onboarding/credentials/page.tsx`: Changed from "Step 2 of 3" ‚Üí "Step 1 of 2"

### Files Modified
```
app/onboarding/page.tsx                    - Removed legal check, redirect to credentials
app/onboarding/create-profile/page.tsx     - Updated messaging (removed "legal accepted")
app/onboarding/credentials/page.tsx        - Updated step counter to 1 of 2
app/api/profile/route.ts                   - Auto-accept legal terms, include license_number in GET, exclude "Other" from licenses
components/forms/CredentialSection.tsx     - Fixed "Other" to not require licenses
```

### Testing Checklist
- [x] New user signup ‚Üí directly to credentials (skips consent)
- [x] Select "Other Professional" ‚Üí no license fields shown ‚úÖ
- [x] Select "CPA" ‚Üí enter license ‚Üí save ‚Üí navigate to profile edit ‚Üí license number retained ‚úÖ
- [x] Check database: new profiles have `tos_version='v1'` and `privacy_version='v1'`

### Database Impact
- New profiles automatically get `tos_version`, `tos_accepted_at`, `privacy_version`, `privacy_accepted_at` on creation
- "Other" credential type profiles will have any existing licenses removed

## Robots.txt & Sitemap.xml Implementation (2025-10-09) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Add first-party robots and sitemap using Next.js App Router native approach.

**Problem**: Need proper SEO infrastructure for Google to crawl static pages and dynamic profile pages.

**Solution Applied**: 
1. Updated `app/robots.ts` to explicitly allow public pages and reference canonical sitemap
2. Enhanced `app/sitemap.ts` to include static pages (/trust, /transparency) + dynamic verified profiles
3. Configured `next-sitemap` to avoid conflicts with App Router native files

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Robots.txt (`app/robots.ts`)
- **Allows**: `/`, `/search`, `/trust`, `/transparency`, `/p/` (profiles)
- **Disallows**: `/join`, `/verify`, `/profile`, `/onboarding`, `/api/`, `/admin/`, `/dashboard/`, `/messages/`
- **Sitemap**: Points to `https://www.taxproexchange.com/sitemap.xml`
- **Format**: Next.js `MetadataRoute.Robots` type
- **Served at**: `/robots.txt`

#### 2. Sitemap (`app/sitemap.ts`)
- **Static pages** (4 total):
  - `/` - Homepage (priority: 1.0, changefreq: weekly)
  - `/search` - Search page (priority: 0.8, changefreq: weekly)
  - `/trust` - Trust & Verification (priority: 0.7, changefreq: monthly)
  - `/transparency` - Site Transparency (priority: 0.7, changefreq: monthly)
- **Dynamic pages**: All verified & listed profiles from database
  - Query: `visibility_state='verified' AND is_listed=true`
  - Limit: 10,000 profiles (handles large datasets)
  - URL format: `/p/{slug}`
  - Priority: 0.6, changefreq: monthly
  - Uses `updated_at` for `lastModified`
- **Database**: Queries Supabase with service role (bypasses RLS)
- **Format**: Next.js `MetadataRoute.Sitemap` type
- **Served at**: `/sitemap.xml`

#### 3. Next-Sitemap Config (`next-sitemap.config.js`)
- **Disabled**: `generateRobotsTxt: false` (using App Router `app/robots.ts` instead)
- **Excluded**: `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt` from static generation to avoid conflicts
- **Purpose**: Generates `sitemap-0.xml` for additional static pages discovered during build
- **Benefit**: Complements dynamic sitemap with build-time discovered pages

### Files Modified
```
app/robots.ts               - Updated to allow /trust, /transparency
app/sitemap.ts              - Added static pages + dynamic profiles query
next-sitemap.config.js      - Disabled robots.txt generation, excluded dynamic files
```

### Testing
```bash
# Build and verify
npm run build

# Check routes are generated
# ‚óã /robots.txt - static
# ‚óã /sitemap.xml - dynamic

# Manual test (after deploy)
curl https://www.taxproexchange.com/robots.txt
curl https://www.taxproexchange.com/sitemap.xml

# Google Search Console
# 1. Submit sitemap at https://www.taxproexchange.com/sitemap.xml
# 2. Verify robots.txt is accessible
# 3. Monitor indexing coverage
```

### Edge Cases Handled
- **Large profile datasets**: Limited to 10,000 (sitemap best practice)
- **Missing data**: Uses `data ?? []` for safe iteration
- **Missing timestamps**: Fallback to `new Date().toISOString()`
- **Canonical domain**: All URLs use `https://www.taxproexchange.com` (www enforced)

### Future Enhancements (if needed)
- [ ] Sitemap index for >10,000 profiles (split into multiple sitemaps)
- [ ] Add `/jobs` and `/events` pages if they become public
- [ ] Image sitemaps for profile photos (if added)
- [ ] Video sitemaps for demo content (if added)

### SEO Benefits
‚úÖ Google can discover all public pages  
‚úÖ Proper crawl budget allocation (disallow admin/internal pages)  
‚úÖ Dynamic profile pages indexed with correct metadata  
‚úÖ Canonical URLs enforced (www subdomain)  
‚úÖ Change frequency hints for crawler optimization

## Live Counters + Badge Legend + Built With Components (2025-10-09) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Add live verification stats, explain badges, and show "Built With" tech stack.

**Problem**: No live counters showing platform growth; users don't understand badge meanings; tech stack not highlighted.

**Solution Applied**: 
1. Enhanced `/api/trust/stats` to count distinct states covered by verified professionals
2. Updated `LiveCounters` to show verified profiles + states covered
3. Added `BadgeLegend` to explain verification badges
4. Created `BuiltWith` component showcasing Clerk, Supabase, Vercel

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Trust Stats API Enhancement (`app/api/trust/stats/route.ts`)
- **New metric:** `statesCovered` - counts distinct states from `profile_locations` table
- Query flow:
  1. Fetch verified profile IDs (where `visibility_state = 'verified'` AND `is_listed = true`)
  2. Join `profile_locations` ‚Üí `locations` to get state data
  3. Count unique states (filter out nulls)
- Returns JSON with `verifiedProfiles`, `statesCovered`, `credentialCounts`, `lastUpdated`
- **Performance:** Optimized with indexed queries; warm cache <500ms
- **Edge case:** Returns `0` for empty database

#### 2. Live Counters Component (`components/Trust/LiveCounters.tsx`)
- **Client component:** Fetches stats from `/api/trust/stats` on mount
- Updated interface to include `statesCovered: number`
- Displays 4 metrics in responsive grid:
  - ‚úì Verified Professionals (green)
  - üó∫Ô∏è States Covered (blue) - **NEW**
  - üéì CPAs (purple)
  - üìã Enrolled Agents (orange)
- Loading state: Animated skeleton UI
- Error state: Graceful fallback message
- Uses Framer Motion for staggered animations

#### 3. Badge Legend Component (`components/Trust/BadgeLegend.tsx`)
- Explains 6 badge types:
  - ‚úì Verified (green) - License verified against official registries
  - üéì CPA (blue) - State Board verified
  - üìã EA (purple) - IRS directory verified
  - üìä CTEC (orange) - CTEC registry verified
  - ‚öñÔ∏è Attorney (indigo) - State Bar verified
  - üîç Pending (yellow) - Verification in progress
- 2-column responsive grid
- Each badge shows colored pill + description
- Hover effect for better UX

#### 4. Built With Component (`components/Trust/BuiltWith.tsx`)
- Shows 3 technology partners:
  - üîê Clerk (Authentication & User Management)
  - üõ°Ô∏è Supabase (PostgreSQL Database with RLS)
  - üîí Vercel (Hosting & HTTPS)
- Each tech card is clickable ‚Üí opens official site
- Staggered fade-in animations
- Compact, tasteful design
- Tagline: "Enterprise-grade security and reliability"

#### 5. Trust Page Integration (`app/trust/page.tsx`)
- Added `BuiltWith` import and section
- Layout order:
  1. Hero
  2. **Live Counters** (stats)
  3. Verification Process (4 steps)
  4. **Badge Legend** (what badges mean)
  5. Lookup Links (external registries)
  6. **Built With** (tech stack)
  7. What We Don't Do
  8. Data Minimization
  9. Reporting

### Files Created/Modified
- `app/api/trust/stats/route.ts` (modified - added states covered query)
- `components/Trust/LiveCounters.tsx` (modified - added states metric)
- `components/Trust/BadgeLegend.tsx` (already existed, confirmed implementation)
- `components/Trust/LookupLinks.tsx` (already existed)
- `components/Trust/BuiltWith.tsx` (new)
- `app/trust/page.tsx` (modified - added BuiltWith component)
- `CURSOR_TASK_NOTES.md` (updated)

### Design Decisions
- **States metric:** Replaced "CTEC Preparers" counter with "States Covered" for broader appeal
- **Footer:** Kept existing compact trust badges (already shows Vercel/Supabase/Clerk) instead of full BuiltWith component - more appropriate for footer real estate
- **SSR compatibility:** Stats fetched client-side (API route) for simplicity; could add server-side fetch in future
- **Caching:** No explicit cache header yet; Vercel edge caching should handle warm requests <500ms
- **Empty DB fallback:** All counters show `0` gracefully

### Database Schema Dependencies
- `profiles` table: `visibility_state`, `is_listed`, `credential_type`
- `profile_locations` table: `profile_id`, `location_id`
- `locations` table: `state` (2-letter state code)

### Testing Notes
- **Manual test:** Visit `/trust` ‚Üí verify counters load <500ms
- **Empty DB:** Counters should show zeros (not errors)
- **Badge legend:** All 6 badges should render with correct colors
- **Built With:** Links should open in new tabs to Clerk/Supabase/Vercel
- **Mobile:** 4-column counters should collapse to 2 columns on mobile

### Future Enhancements
- Add caching headers to `/api/trust/stats` (e.g., `s-maxage=300` for 5min cache)
- Consider SSR for LiveCounters (fetch stats server-side, pass as props)
- Add more granular stats (e.g., "Cities covered", "Specializations offered")
- Track historical growth (line chart of verified profiles over time)

### Auth & Security
- `/api/trust/stats`: Public route (no auth required)
- All components: Public, no authentication
- Data: Read-only queries, no PII exposed

## Footer Trust Signals + Site Transparency Page (2025-10-09) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Add subtle trust signals to footer and create a comprehensive transparency micro-page.

**Problem**: Footer lacked trust elements; no central location for infrastructure/security transparency.

**Solution Applied**: Added trust signal badges to footer and created `/transparency` page with detailed infrastructure, security, and data practices.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Footer Trust Signals (`components/Footer.tsx`)
- Added compact trust badges above main footer content:
  - üîí "HTTPS by Vercel"
  - üõ°Ô∏è "RLS on Supabase"
  - üîê "Clerk Auth"
- Badges use small pill design (bg-slate-50, rounded-lg, border)
- Responsive flex-wrap for mobile
- Added "Transparency" link to footer navigation
- Added subtle top border to footer (`border-t border-slate-100`)

#### 2. Transparency Page (`app/transparency/page.tsx`)
- **Public route** - no authentication required
- Comprehensive sections:
  - **At a Glance:** Quick facts grid (domain, hosting, auth, database, security)
  - **Infrastructure & Security:** Hosting (Vercel), Database (Supabase + RLS), Authentication (Clerk SOC 2)
  - **Data Practices:** What we collect/don't collect, data location (US-based)
  - **Email Security:** SPF, DKIM, DMARC status
  - **Platform Boundaries:** Explicitly states what we don't do (no payments, no file storage)
  - **Compliance & Standards:** CCPA/CPRA, GDPR, CAN-SPAM, professional credential standards
  - **Contact & Accountability:** Support and security email addresses
- Styled to match legal pages (privacy/terms) with Framer Motion
- Uses prose styling for readability
- Links to /trust and /legal/privacy for cross-reference

#### 3. Middleware Update (`middleware.ts`)
- Added `/transparency` to public routes matcher
- Page accessible without authentication

### Files Created/Modified
- `components/Footer.tsx` (modified - added trust signals and transparency link)
- `app/transparency/page.tsx` (new)
- `middleware.ts` (modified - added /transparency to public routes)
- `CURSOR_TASK_NOTES.md` (updated)

### Design Decisions
- **Compact footer design:** Trust signals are small badges, not intrusive
- **Static content:** Transparency page is static (can be updated manually as infrastructure changes)
- **Security email:** Added security@taxproexchange.com for responsible disclosure
- **Platform boundaries:** Explicitly states no payment processing, no file storage to set expectations
- **US-based:** All data storage in US (relevant for tax professional audience)
- **Email security:** Documents SPF/DKIM/DMARC status (assumes configured - verify in DNS)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Footer trust badges display on all pages
- [ ] Footer "Transparency" link navigates to `/transparency`
- [ ] `/transparency` page loads without auth (public route)
- [ ] Page is mobile responsive
- [ ] Links to /trust and /legal/privacy work
- [ ] Email links (support@, security@) open mail client
- [ ] Page loads < 2s

### Follow-up Tasks
- Verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC are actually configured in DNS (update transparency page if needed)
- Consider adding "Last Updated" date to transparency page
- May want to add "security.txt" file for responsible disclosure (optional)

## Events Link Health Validation System (2025-01-04) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Fix event URL retrieval by implementing robust link validation system that only returns verified, non-404 links.

**Problem**: Events system pulls URLs from OpenAI but these URLs often result in 404s or broken links, leading to poor user experience.

**Solution Applied**: Complete link health validation system with staging pipeline, URL scoring, and automated validation.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Database Schema & Migration
- **Created**: `database/migrations/2025-01-04_events_link_health.sql`
- **New Tables**:
  - `staging_events`: Raw event data before validation
  - `event_url_tombstones`: Permanently dead URLs to avoid re-checking
- **Enhanced Events Table**: Added link health columns:
  - `candidate_url`: Original URL from source
  - `canonical_url`: Resolved canonical URL after redirects
  - `url_status`: Last HTTP status code
  - `redirect_chain`: Array of URLs visited during redirect resolution
  - `link_health_score`: Score 0-100 (‚â•70 required for publishable)
  - `last_checked_at`: Last validation timestamp
  - `publishable`: Boolean flag (link health ‚â•70 and checked within 24h)
  - `dedupe_key`: SHA1 hash for deduplication

#### 2. Link Checker Utility (`lib/linkChecker.ts`)
- **URL Validation**: HEAD/GET requests with proper user agent and headers
- **Redirect Handling**: Follows redirects up to 5 hops, tracks redirect chain
- **Scoring Algorithm**: 
  - Base score: 40 points for 200 OK, 20 for redirects
  - Keyword matching: +30 points for title matches
  - Canonical URL: +15 points bonus
  - SPA detection: -10 points for likely JS-rendered content
  - Redirect penalty: -3 points per redirect
- **URL Healing**: Removes problematic query params (UTM, tracking)
- **Tombstone Detection**: Identifies permanently dead URLs

#### 3. Event Validation Worker (`lib/validateEvents.ts`)
- **Batch Processing**: Validates events in batches (default 100)
- **Smart Scheduling**: Only validates if not checked in last 24 hours
- **Tombstone Integration**: Checks and creates tombstones for dead URLs
- **Publishable Logic**: Events need score ‚â•70 and status <400
- **Individual Validation**: Single event validation by ID

#### 4. Event Ingestion Pipeline (`lib/normalizeEvent.ts`)
- **Staging System**: Raw events go to staging_events first
- **Normalization**: Standardizes event data format
- **Deduplication**: SHA1 hash-based deduplication by title|start_date|organizer
- **Direct Ingestion**: Alternative path for immediate processing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing `url` field

#### 5. API Route Updates
- **Events API** (`app/api/events/route.ts`): Only returns `publishable=true` events
- **Manual Recheck** (`app/api/events/recheck/route.ts`): On-demand validation endpoint
- **Refresh Routes**: Updated to use new ingestion pipeline with validation
- **Response Enhancement**: Includes link health score and last checked timestamp

#### 6. Automated Validation
- **Vercel Cron**: Daily validation at 10:00 UTC (`vercel.json`)
- **Manual Trigger**: POST to `/api/events/recheck` for on-demand validation
- **Status Monitoring**: GET endpoint for validation statistics

#### 7. Testing Infrastructure
- **Unit Tests** (`tests/linkChecker.test.ts`): Comprehensive link checker testing
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/validateEvents.test.ts`): Event validation worker testing
- **Curl Examples** (`tests/curl-examples.md`): Manual testing guide

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ **Never surface 404 links**: Events API only returns verified events
- ‚úÖ **Automated healing**: Common URL issues (redirects, moved pages) auto-resolved
- ‚úÖ **Tombstone system**: Dead URLs marked to avoid infinite re-checking
- ‚úÖ **Smart scoring**: Multi-factor algorithm considers status, content, redirects
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimized**: Batch processing, 24h validation intervals
- ‚úÖ **Monitoring**: Validation statistics and health metrics
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatible**: Existing API shape maintained

### Technical Constraints Met
- **Stack**: Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Supabase Postgres, Vercel Cron
- **No external dependencies**: Built-in fetch, no Playwright required
- **Modular design**: Separate utilities for link checking, validation, ingestion
- **Testable**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- **Production ready**: Error handling, logging, monitoring

### Acceptance Criteria Met
- ‚úÖ Events API never returns 404 links in normal operation
- ‚úÖ `publishable=true` only when `link_health_score ‚â• 70` and `last_checked_at ‚â§ 24h`
- ‚úÖ Redirects & canonical URLs respected; bad links auto-healed
- ‚úÖ Manual/cron recheck functionality working
- ‚úÖ Tests pass with comprehensive coverage

### 2025-01-XX: Fixed Admin Profile Verification Email Links ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Fix the 404 error in admin profile verification emails by correcting the URL format from `/admin/profiles/[id]` to `/p/[slug]?admin=true`.

**Root Cause**: 
- Admin profile verification emails were linking to `/admin/profiles/[id]` which doesn't exist
- The correct route for admin profile viewing is `/p/[slug]?admin=true` (public profile route with admin parameter)
- This caused 404 errors when admins clicked the "Review & Verify Profile" button in emails

**Solution Applied**:

#### 1. Fixed Profile Completion Notification API
- **Updated Route**: `app/api/notify/profile-completed/route.ts`
- **Added Slug Lookup**: Now fetches the profile's slug from the database before generating the email
- **Corrected URL Format**: Changed from `/admin/profiles/${profile_id}` to `/p/${profile.slug}?admin=true`
- **Added Supabase Service**: Imported and used supabaseService for database queries

#### 2. Enhanced Admin Profile Viewing Experience
- **Admin Banner**: Added prominent blue admin banner when viewing profiles in admin mode
- **Admin Navigation**: Added admin-specific navigation links (Admin, Profiles) in the header
- **Admin Actions**: Added quick access buttons for Edit Profile and Back to Profiles
- **Admin Information Panel**: Added amber-colored admin information section showing:
  - Profile ID
  - Visibility State (with color-coded badges)
  - Listed in Search status
  - Creation date
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear admin mode indicators with icons and color coding

### 2025-01-XX: Email Migration to Resend with SPF/DKIM/DMARC Alignment ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Migrate all email sending to Resend (no Amazon SES anywhere) and ensure proper SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment so Gmail shows SPF=PASS, DKIM=PASS, DMARC=PASS for taxproexchange.com.

**Root Cause**: 
- Some messages were being sent via Amazon SES (headers showed amazonses.com and MAIL FROM send.taxproexchange.com)
- This caused SPF to fail and Gmail to mark emails as spam
- Mixed email providers created inconsistent deliverability

**Solution Applied**:

#### 1. Updated Email Utility (`lib/email.ts`)

- **List-Unsubscribe Headers**: Added automatic List-Unsubscribe headers for better deliverability
- **Environment Variables**: Added EMAIL_FROM and EMAIL_REPLY_TO configuration
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained legacy sendEmail function for existing code
- **Proper Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling and logging

#### 2. Replaced Supabase Edge Function

- **Eliminated Mixed Providers**: No more calls to Supabase Edge Functions that used SES
- **Consistent Sending**: All emails now go through single Resend pipeline

#### 3. Updated All Email Endpoints
- **Standardized Function Calls**: Updated all API routes to use new sendEmail signature
- **Files Updated**:
  - `app/api/admin/request-profile-update/route.ts`
  - `app/api/admin/request-verification-info/route.ts`
  - `app/api/notify/job-application-received/route.ts`
  - `app/api/notify/application-status-changed/route.ts`
  - `app/api/test/resend/route.ts`

#### 4. Environment Configuration
- **Updated env.example**: Added Resend configuration variables
- **New Variables**:
  - `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key for authentication
  - `EMAIL_FROM` - From address (defaults to support@taxproexchange.com)
  - `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` - Reply-to address (defaults to support@taxproexchange.com)

#### 5. Final Cleanup (2025-01-XX)
- **Removed Nodemailer**: Uninstalled unused nodemailer dependency
- **Created Test Route**: Added `/api/test/email` endpoint for email system verification
- **Verified No SES**: Confirmed no Amazon SES code remains in codebase

**Technical Details**:
- **From Address**: All emails now sent from support@taxproexchange.com
- **Reply-To**: Set to support@taxproexchange.com or koen@cardifftax.com
- **List-Unsubscribe**: Automatic mailto: unsubscribe headers added
- **SPF/DKIM/DMARC**: Resend handles proper domain authentication
- **No SES Usage**: Completely removed Amazon SES from codebase

**Email Headers Now Include**:
```
From: support@taxproexchange.com
Reply-To: support@taxproexchange.com
List-Unsubscribe: mailto:support@taxproexchange.com?subject=unsubscribe
X-Provider: resend
X-No-SES: true
```

**Expected Gmail Results**:
- SPF=PASS (domain taxproexchange.com)
- DKIM=PASS (taxproexchange.com)
- DMARC=PASS (due to DKIM alignment)
- No amazonses.com in any headers

### 2025-01-XX: Fixed Jobs API Database Error ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Resolve the "Database error" that was preventing the jobs page from loading after the "Harden & Ship" features were deleted.

**Root Cause**: 
- The jobs API (`/api/jobs`) was trying to use a foreign key relationship `profiles!jobs_created_by_fkey` that doesn't exist in the database
- This relationship was part of the "Harden & Ship" features that were deleted
- The API was also trying to call a notification webhook endpoint that no longer exists

**Solution Applied**:
- **Removed Foreign Key Join**: Changed from `select('*, profiles!jobs_created_by_fkey(...)')` to `select('*')`
- **Manual Profile Lookup**: Added manual profile lookup for each job using `clerk_id` to get firm information
- **Removed Notification Webhook**: Removed the call to `/api/notify/job-created` endpoint that was deleted
- **Maintained Functionality**: Kept all filtering, validation, and job creation features intact

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/jobs/route.ts` - Fixed GET and POST methods to work without deleted features

**Technical Details**:
- Jobs are fetched with basic `select('*')` query
- Firm information is retrieved manually for each job using `Promise.all()`
- Profile lookup uses `clerk_id` to match `created_by` field
- Verification filtering is maintained to only show jobs from verified firms
- All existing filters (specialization, state, payout, etc.) continue to work

**Testing**:
- ‚úÖ Jobs page loads without database errors
- ‚úÖ Job listing displays correctly with firm information
- ‚úÖ Job creation still works for verified firms
- ‚úÖ All filters continue to function properly
- ‚úÖ Build passes successfully

**Result**: The jobs functionality is now fully restored and working without the deleted "Harden & Ship" features.

**Root Cause**: 
- The main page header was missing the "Jobs" link in the navigation menu
- The UserMenu dropdown was also missing a link to the job board
- Users couldn't easily discover or access the job board functionality

**Solution Applied**:
- **Added Jobs Link to Main Header**: Added `<a href="/jobs">Jobs</a>` to the main page navigation
- **Added Job Board to UserMenu**: Added "Job Board" link to the UserMenu dropdown with appropriate icon
- **Consistent Navigation**: Ensured jobs are accessible from both the main header and user dropdown menu

**Files Modified**:

### 2025-01-XX: Fixed Onboarding Error and Hydration Mismatch ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Resolve the onboarding database error and fix hydration mismatches in the job filters.

**Root Cause**: 
- **Onboarding Error**: `COALESCE types uuid and integer cannot be matched` - Type mismatch in database upsert operation
- **Hydration Mismatch**: Browser extensions adding `fdprocessedid` attributes to form elements causing server/client HTML mismatch

**Solution Applied**:

#### **1. Fixed Onboarding Database Error**
- **Replaced upsert with insert**: Changed from `.upsert()` to `.insert()` to avoid type conflicts
- **Added profile existence check**: Check if profile already exists before attempting to create
- **Simplified field mapping**: Use only essential fields (`clerk_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `credential_type`) to avoid schema mismatches
- **Added fallback values**: Provide default values for required fields

#### **2. Fixed Hydration Mismatch**
- **Added suppressHydrationWarning**: Applied to all form elements in JobFilters component
- **Covered all interactive elements**: Button, select dropdowns, and number input
- **Prevents browser extension interference**: Silences warnings from browser extensions that modify HTML

**Files Modified**:
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Fixed database type mismatch error
- `components/jobs/JobFilters.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning to all form elements

**Technical Details**:
- **Onboarding**: Uses simple insert instead of complex upsert to avoid PostgreSQL type conflicts
- **Hydration**: `suppressHydrationWarning` prevents React from complaining about browser extension modifications
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to home page if onboarding fails

**Testing**:
- ‚úÖ Onboarding no longer shows database type mismatch error
- ‚úÖ Job filters no longer show hydration mismatch warnings
- ‚úÖ Form elements work correctly without console errors

### 2025-01-XX: RLS Hardening Migration - Fixed Search Page Data Access ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Fix the search page returning no data after RLS migration by updating API endpoints to use service role key instead of anonymous key.

**Root Cause**: 
- The RLS migration enabled Row Level Security on all tables
- Search and specializations API endpoints were using `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
- Anonymous key can no longer access protected tables like `profiles`, `profile_specializations`, etc.
- Server-side APIs need to use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to bypass RLS

**Solution Applied**:

#### 1. Updated Search API (`app/api/search/route.ts`)
- **Changed Key**: From `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Bypasses RLS**: Service role key can access all data regardless of RLS policies
- **Maintains Security**: Client-side access still protected by RLS policies

#### 2. Updated Specializations API (`app/api/specializations/route.ts`)
- **Changed Key**: From `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Public Data Access**: Ensures specializations and groups remain accessible for UI dropdowns

#### 3. Updated Critical Admin APIs
- **Profile API**: `app/api/profile/[slug]/route.ts` - Now uses service role key
- **Admin APIs**: Updated multiple admin endpoints to use service role key
- **Verification APIs**: Updated verification submission and admin approval endpoints

**Files Modified**: 8 files, ~15 lines changed

**Technical Details**:
- **Service Role Key**: Bypasses all RLS policies for server-side operations
- **Anonymous Key**: Still used for client-side operations (properly restricted by RLS)
- **Security Model**: Server APIs can access all data, client access is restricted
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

**Security Architecture**:
- ‚úÖ **Client Access**: Restricted by RLS policies (users can only see their own data)
- ‚úÖ **Server Access**: Full access via service role key (for search, admin, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Public Data**: Reference tables (locations, specializations) accessible to all
- ‚úÖ **User Data**: Protected by ownership-based RLS policies

**Testing Checklist**:
- [x] Search page loads and displays profiles correctly
- [x] Specialization dropdowns work in all forms
- [x] Admin functions continue working
- [x] User data access is properly restricted
- [x] Public reference data remains accessible
- [x] No console errors or permission denied errors

**Result**: Search functionality is fully restored while maintaining the security benefits of the RLS migration. The search page now returns data correctly and all API endpoints work as expected.

### 2025-01-XX: Enhanced Admin Profiles Page for Faster User Approval ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Improve the admin profiles page to filter out verified/listed users by default and show license information concisely for faster approval decisions.

**Root Cause**: 
- Admin was overwhelmed with too many users, including already verified and listed ones
- No way to filter to see only users needing approval

### 2025-01-XX: Fixed URL Validation UX Issue ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Fix the "invalid URL" error users were getting during setup when they didn't manually add "https://" to URLs.

**Root Cause**: 
- Users were getting "invalid URL" errors when entering URLs without protocol (e.g., "example.com")
- Zod validation was rejecting URLs that didn't start with "http://" or "https://"
- Poor UX requiring users to manually add protocol prefixes

**Solution Applied**:

#### 1. Created URL Normalization Utility (`lib/utils/url.ts`)
- **normalizeUrl()**: Automatically adds "https://" to URLs missing protocol
- **isValidUrl()**: Validates URLs after normalization
- **Handles Edge Cases**: Empty strings, null values, URLs with "//" prefix
- **Smart Detection**: Preserves existing protocols (http/https)

#### 2. Updated Zod Schemas (`lib/validations/zodSchemas.ts`)
- **URL Fields**: Updated `website_url`, `linkedin_url`, `avatar_url`, `board_profile_url`
- **Transform Step**: Added `.transform()` to normalize URLs before validation
- **Validation**: Uses custom `isValidUrl()` function instead of Zod's built-in URL validation
- **Backward Compatible**: Maintains existing API structure

#### 3. Enhanced UI Components
- **CredentialSection**: Updated Board Profile URL input with better placeholder and hint text
- **Profile Edit Form**: Updated Website and LinkedIn inputs with helpful placeholder text
- **User Guidance**: Added hints like "https:// will be added automatically if missing"

**Files Modified**: 4 files, ~50 lines changed
**Files Created**: 1 new file (`lib/utils/url.ts`)

**Technical Details**:
- **URL Normalization**: `example.com` ‚Üí `https://example.com`
- **Protocol Preservation**: `http://example.com` ‚Üí `http://example.com` (unchanged)
- **Empty Handling**: `""` or `null` ‚Üí `""` (empty string, not normalized)
- **Double Slash**: `//example.com` ‚Üí `https://example.com`
- **Validation**: Only validates after normalization

**User Experience Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ **No More Errors**: Users can enter "example.com" without getting validation errors
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Protocol**: "https://" is added automatically behind the scenes
- ‚úÖ **Clear Guidance**: UI hints explain that protocol will be added automatically
- ‚úÖ **Flexible Input**: Accepts both "example.com" and "https://example.com"
- ‚úÖ **Better Placeholders**: More helpful placeholder text in form fields

### 2025-10-01: Fixed Admin Dashboard Redirect Issue ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Fix the issue where admin users clicking "Admin Panel" in the user menu were being redirected to `/profile/edit` instead of the admin dashboard.

**Root Cause**: 
- The middleware was checking for `onboarding_complete` cookie on ALL routes (including admin routes)
- If the cookie wasn't set to '1', middleware redirected to `/profile/edit`
- Admin routes (`/admin/*`) were not exempt from the onboarding check
- This prevented admin users from accessing the admin dashboard

**Solution Applied**:

#### 1. Added Admin Route Matcher
- **NEW**: `isAdmin` route matcher for `/admin(.*)` paths
- Added to middleware alongside existing `isPublic`, `isOnboarding`, and `isDashboard` matchers

#### 2. Bypass Onboarding Check for Admin Routes
- Admin routes now skip the `onboarding_complete` check
- Admins can access admin dashboard regardless of onboarding status
- Maintains security - still requires authentication via Clerk

**Files Modified**: 1 file, ~5 lines changed
- `middleware.ts` - Added admin route matcher and bypass logic

**Technical Details**:
- **Route Matcher**: `createRouteMatcher(['/admin(.*)'])` matches all admin routes
- **Check Order**: Admin check happens BEFORE onboarding check
- **Debug Headers**: Added `x-debug-redirect: 'none (admin)'` for debugging
- **Preserved Logic**: All other middleware behavior unchanged

**Middleware Flow**:
1. Public routes ‚Üí allow
2. No user/session ‚Üí allow (Clerk handles)
3. Dashboard routes ‚Üí allow
4. Onboarding routes ‚Üí allow
5. **Admin routes ‚Üí allow (NEW!)**
6. Check onboarding cookie ‚Üí redirect if incomplete
7. Otherwise ‚Üí allow

**Testing**:
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds without errors
- ‚úÖ Admin routes bypass onboarding check
- ‚úÖ Non-admin routes still check onboarding status
- ‚úÖ Admin panel accessible from user menu

**Commands to Run**:
```bash
# No commands needed - middleware change is automatic
# Build already verified successful
```

**Result**: Admin users can now access the admin dashboard via the "Admin Panel" menu item without being redirected to profile edit. The fix maintains all existing security while allowing admins to manage the platform regardless of their onboarding status.

## Partners Landing Page with AI Technology Partners (October 15, 2025)

### Problem
The /partners page needed to showcase specific AI technology partners with individual detail pages rather than just general partnership information.

### Solution
Enhanced the Partners page to feature AI-focused technology partners (BlueJ, Truss, TaxGPT) with a responsive grid layout and dynamic detail pages. Created a data-driven approach using JSON for easy partner management.

### Files Created
- **data/partners.json**: Partner data with id, name, slug, tagline, description, logo path, website, and category
- **app/partners/components/PartnerCard.tsx**: Reusable partner card component with Framer Motion hover animations
- **app/partners/[slug]/page.tsx**: Dynamic partner detail pages with 'Coming Soon' placeholder content

### Files Modified
- **app/partners/page.tsx**: Updated hero messaging to focus on AI partnerships; added partner grid pulling from JSON data

### Features
**Partners Index Page (/partners):**
- Hero section emphasizing AI-forward partnerships in tax/accounting/wealth management
- Responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)
- Partner cards with:
  - Logo placeholder with partner name
  - Category badge (AI Tax Technology)
  - Tagline and description with line-clamp
  - Hover animation (lift effect)
  - Click-through to detail page
- 'Why Partner' section with 4 value props

**Partner Detail Pages (/partners/[slug]):**
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Hero with logo, category, name, tagline, description
- External website link with icon
- 'Coming Soon' section with construction emoji and CTA
- Related partners section showing other partners
- Full SEO metadata per partner
- Static generation for all partner slugs

### Current Partners
1. **BlueJ**: AI-powered tax research and compliance platform
2. **Truss**: Intelligent document processing for tax firms
3. **TaxGPT**: Conversational AI for tax guidance

### Technical Details
- Uses Next.js 15 App Router with dynamic routes
- generateStaticParams() for pre-rendering all partner pages
- Framer Motion for card animations (opacity, y-offset, hover lift)
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Responsive Tailwind grid system
- Logo placeholders (ready for actual SVG logos in /public/partners/)
- Consistent with site design patterns (rounded-2xl cards, slate color scheme)

### Adding New Partners
To add a new partner, simply add an entry to data/partners.json following the schema. No code changes required.

## Partners Navigation Enhancement - Icon and Mobile Dropdown (October 15, 2025)

### Problem
The Partners link needed a visual identifier (handshake icon) and mobile navigation needed better organization with a collapsible 'Community' section for related links.

### Solution
Added handshake emoji () to Partners links across all navigation components and created a collapsible 'Community' dropdown in mobile navigation that groups Directory, Jobs, Events, Mentorship, and Partners together.

### Files Modified
- **components/AppNavigation.tsx**: Added  emoji to Partners link with flex layout for proper icon/text alignment
- **components/HomePageClient.tsx**: Added  emoji to Partners link in homepage navigation
- **components/MobileNav.tsx**: Complete restructure with collapsible Community dropdown

### Desktop Navigation
**Partners link now displays:**
-  Partners (with handshake emoji)
- Icon and text aligned with gap-1.5 spacing
- Active route highlighting still works
- Consistent hover effects

### Mobile Navigation Structure
**Logged-out users:**
- Features, How it works, FAQ (top level)
- **Community** (expandable dropdown)
  - Directory
  - Jobs
  - Events
  - Mentorship
  -  Partners
- Join (bottom level)

**Logged-in users:**
- Dashboard (top level)
- **Community** (expandable dropdown)
  - Directory
  - Jobs
  -  Partners

### Features
- Expandable/collapsible Community section with chevron rotation animation
- Smooth height/opacity transitions using Framer Motion
- Indented sub-items for visual hierarchy
- Active route highlighting throughout
- Partners link includes handshake emoji in dropdown too

### Technical Details
- Uses React state (isCommunityOpen) to manage dropdown toggle
- Framer Motion AnimatePresence for smooth expand/collapse
- Chevron rotates 180 when open
- Smaller text/padding for dropdown items vs top-level items
- Overflow-y-auto on nav for long lists

## 2025-10-21: Job Application Email Notifications

**Issue**: No email notifications were being sent when someone applied to a job.

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated `app/api/jobs/[id]/apply/route.ts` to trigger email notifications after successful application submission
   - Added notification to job poster (`/api/notify/job-application-received`)

   - Both notifications are non-blocking (won't fail application if emails fail)

2. Fixed bug in `app/api/notify/application-confirmation/route.ts`
   - Was incorrectly fetching job poster's profile instead of applicant's
   - Now accepts `applicant_clerk_id` parameter and fetches correct profile
   - Properly respects applicant's email preferences

**Files Changed**:
- app/api/jobs/[id]/apply/route.ts
- app/api/notify/application-confirmation/route.ts

- Displays how long the job has been open
- Lists recent applicants with their details (name, title, proposed rate, cover note preview)
- Provides direct link to review all applications
- Skips jobs with zero applications

**New Files**:
- app/api/admin/send-job-poster-digests/route.ts - API endpoint for sending digest emails

**Features**:
