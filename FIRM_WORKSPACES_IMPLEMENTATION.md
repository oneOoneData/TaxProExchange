- Verified flag
- Unique slug for public profile URL

### firm_members
- Links profiles to firms with roles (admin/manager/member)
- Status: active, invited, removed
- Unique constraint per (firm_id, profile_id)

### firm_trusted_bench
- Links trusted individual profiles to firms
- custom_title, categories[], note, priority
- visibility_public toggle
- Unique constraint per (firm_id, trusted_profile_id)

---

## Key Features

### ✅ When Flag is ON
1. **Firm Creation** - `/onboarding/firm` creates firm + makes user admin
2. **Team Dashboard** - `/firm/dashboard/team` manages bench
3. **Add Professionals** - Search directory and add to roster
4. **Inline Editing** - Custom titles, notes, categories per team member
5. **Reordering** - Up/down controls update priority
6. **Public/Private Toggle** - Choose which team members are public
7. **Public Profile** - `/f/[slug]` shows firm + public team members
8. **Multi-Firm Support** - Users can be members of multiple firms

### ✅ When Flag is OFF
- All new routes return 404
- No UI changes to existing app
- Existing flows completely unaffected

---

## Authorization Rules

- **Create Firm**: Any authenticated user
- **Manage Firm**: Active admin/manager members only
- **View/Edit Bench**: Active members only
- **Public Firm Profile**: Anyone (read-only)
- **RLS Enforced**: All queries go through Row Level Security policies

---

## Next Steps

### Before Launch
1. **Run Migration**:
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database < database/2025-10-10_firms_and_bench.sql
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FIRM_WORKSPACES=true
   ```

3. **Test Scenarios**:
   - [ ] Create a firm → becomes admin
   - [ ] Add 2-3 professionals to bench
   - [ ] Edit titles, notes, categories
   - [ ] Reorder with ▲/▼ controls
   - [ ] Toggle public visibility
   - [ ] Visit `/f/[slug]` → see only public items
   - [ ] Remove an item → can re-add later
   - [ ] Try editing firm you don't belong to → blocked

4. **Linter Check**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

5. **Type Check**:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Send messages "as firm" (prep: sender_firm_id added to messages table)
- Firm billing/subscription
- Invitation system for firm members
- Firm job postings
- Team analytics dashboard
- Firm verification process

✅ Empty states with CTAs  
✅ Slug collision handling  
✅ Member permission checks
