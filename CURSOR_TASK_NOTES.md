### 2025-01-XX: Fixed Admin Profile View Issue ✅

**Goal**: Resolve issue where admin users clicking "View" on profiles were getting null URLs (`/p/null?admin=true`) and couldn't view profiles.

**Root Cause**: 
- Some profiles in the database don't have slugs generated
- Admin profiles API was returning profiles with `null` slugs
- View links were being generated as `/p/null?admin=true` causing 404 errors

**Changes Made**:

1. **Profile API** (`app/api/profile/[slug]/route.ts`)
   - Added admin context detection via referer header and query parameter
   - Bypasses visibility restrictions (`visibility_state = 'verified'` and `is_listed = true`) for admin requests
   - Allows admins to view any profile regardless of status

2. **Admin Profiles API** (`app/api/admin/profiles/route.ts`)
   - Added fallback slug generation for profiles without slugs
   - Format: `{firstname}-{lastname}-{id-prefix}`
   - Added debugging to track profile data and slug generation

3. **Admin Profiles Page** (`app/admin/profiles/page.tsx`)
   - Added conditional rendering for View link (only shows when slug exists)
   - Added visual warning indicator for profiles without slugs
   - View links now include `?admin=true` parameter
   - Added debugging to track API responses

4. **Profile View Page** (`app/p/[slug]/page.tsx`)
   - Added admin context detection via URL parameter
   - Shows admin navigation links when viewing in admin mode
   - Maintains existing functionality for regular users

**Technical Details**:
- Admin detection via referer header (`/admin`) or query param (`?admin=true`)
- Fallback slug generation ensures all profiles can be viewed
- Conditional View link prevents broken URLs
- Visual indicators help admins identify problematic profiles

**Files Modified**: 4 files, ~50 lines changed

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Admin can view profiles with valid slugs
- [ ] Admin can view profiles without slugs (fallback generated)
- [ ] View links include admin parameter
- [ ] Non-admin users still see visibility restrictions
- [ ] Visual warnings show for profiles without slugs
- [ ] Console debugging shows profile data correctly

**Next Steps**:
- Test admin profile viewing functionality
- Verify fallback slug generation works
- Check that regular user access is still restricted
- Consider implementing proper slug generation for new profiles

### 2025-01-XX: Implemented Grouped Taxonomy for Tax Specializations ✅

**Goal**: Replace flat "Tax Specializations" with a grouped taxonomy for better organization and user experience.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Database Migration** (`database/2025_add_specialization_groups.sql`)
   - Created `specialization_groups` table with 13 categories
   - Added `group_key` column to `specializations` table
   - Seeded with comprehensive taxonomy (85+ specializations across all groups)
   - Added performance indexes

2. **API Updates** (`app/api/specializations/route.ts`)
   - Updated to return grouped data structure
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for `SpecializationGroup` and `Specialization`
   - Groups specializations by their `group_key`

3. **Profile Edit Page** (`app/profile/edit/page.tsx`)
   - Replaced flat specialization list with grouped accordion-style UI
   - Added search functionality to filter specializations
   - Added "Clear Group" and "Clear All" functionality
   - Shows selected count and organized by categories

4. **Public Profile Page** (`app/p/[slug]/page.tsx`)
   - Updated to display specializations grouped by category
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Maintains existing styling while showing organizational structure

5. **Search Page** (`app/search/page.tsx`)
   - Updated filters to use grouped specializations
   - Added radio button selection for each specialization
   - Organized filters by category for better UX
   - Fixed layout to use proper sidebar structure

**Taxonomy Groups Implemented**:

**Files Modified**: 4 files, ~150 lines changed
**Database**: 1 new migration file

**Next Steps**:
- Run the database migration in Supabase
- Test the new grouped UI in profile edit
- Verify search filters work correctly
- Test public profile display

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Profile edit shows grouped specializations
- [ ] Search and filter works within groups
