# Testing Instructions for Jeremy Wells

## What Was Fixed
Your profile couldn't be updated because of a database ID mismatch. We've fixed the lookup logic so it now finds and updates your profile correctly.

## How to Test

### 1. Deploy the Fix
```bash
# Push to production
git add app/api/profile/route.ts CURSOR_TASK_NOTES.md
git commit -m "Fix profile update for users with email-based profiles"
git push origin main

# Or deploy directly with Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Ask Jeremy to Test
Send Jeremy this message:

---

**Hi Jeremy,**

We've fixed the profile update issue you reported. Can you please try completing your profile again?

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://taxpro.exchange/onboarding (or wherever you were trying to complete your profile)
2. Fill in your information (it should still have what you previously entered)
3. Click Submit

**Expected result**: Profile should save successfully and redirect to your profile page

**If it works**: Let us know and you're all set! üéâ

**If it still fails**: Send us the error message you see

---

### 3. Monitor Vercel Logs

While Jeremy is testing, watch the logs:
```bash
vercel logs --prod --follow
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ `üîç Profile found by email: 1b846f72-2571-44de-9c94-1e3056702048`
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ Specializations saved successfully`
- ‚úÖ No `Profile save error: PGRST116`

### 4. Verify in Database (After Success)

Once Jeremy confirms it works, check Supabase:
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  clerk_id,
  clerk_user_id,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  public_email,
  onboarding_complete,
  updated_at
FROM profiles
WHERE public_email = 'jeremy@steadfastbookkeeping.com';
```

Expected:
- `clerk_id` should now be `user_34AJKOI8P7wDo5rGKRRlXkOVHu5`
- `onboarding_complete` should be `true`
- `updated_at` should be recent

## What's Next?

After confirming this works:
1. ‚úÖ Jeremy can use the platform normally
2. üîß We'll do the full `clerk_id` cleanup to prevent this for other users
3. üìä Check if any other users have this issue
